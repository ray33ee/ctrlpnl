Version 1.0.1
    - Initial opening of script removed from device.py (device.py should not load any modules itself, the host should do this exclusively)
    - We now have a 'colours' member in scripts which stores the initial colours of all the used button indicators
    - CtrlPnlFrams now has colours function which fascilitates the setting of button indicator colours
    - When we call load script, we now get the initial colours from the host
    - Added colours in our test script, volume_script.py
    - Writes for bass and preamp are performed in one function, solving Permission denied bug
