Communication:
 - If the device fails to communicate with host, disable the GUI until communication starts/resumes
 - Think about who initiates communication, host or device. Take into account scenarios where host is loaded first then device,
   and visa versa.
 - Think about how the host decides which com port to use

Code:
 - Add comments
    - to unclear code
    - to all functions
 - Reorganise:
    - Remove PanelRow class, and use grid instead.
 - Remove loops (such as those waiting for a response from serial port) from within main GUI loop
    - When waiting for response via serial, implement a timeout
 - Cleanup absolutely disgusting system tray code. Add to its own class, or the CtrlPnlHostFrame class?

Misc
 - Implement dial code. Only call dial functions when the dial value has changed enough (i.e. the difference between this value and the previous is greater than some value epsilon)
 - When the host code exits, send a signal for the device code to stop too?
 - Figure out how to start device.py on startup
